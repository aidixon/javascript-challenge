# javascript-challenge

The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate knowledge of javascript and D3. The html is able to render a table upon loading, and is able to render data that matches the filter upon input for the date in "0/00/0000" format. Once a match appears, the table filters out the data that doesn't match the user input. The image shows an example of the data being filtered.
